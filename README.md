# THE-LAUNDRY-SOFTWARE
I go to a residential school, there we have to put our clothes for laundry,we are given slips of paper-containing info like:types of clothes,roll no,dormitory name,etc.
I noticed since we were 450 or so boys, this wastes a lot of paper,EVERY WEEK.
Hence this piece of code helps maintain record of the same info but in a spreadsheet application,data entered with python,so that users don't have to use the spreadsheet application.
This code might seem uselss outside,but it'll save a lot of paper! So cheers to the Environment!
Yours truly,
